You are a newly recruited analyst programmer, working for a major IT company. This company
own information about film projects, such as “E.T.” and the “Fast and the Furious” series.
Now, you are expect to design and implement a new software system for a client called TrekStar
Pictures. In a meeting with a TrekStar Pictures representative, a number of requirements have
been discussed and you have identified the following:

Every time the production of a new film begins, a new project is created. This project has all
the relevant information regarding the production of the film. Each new project has a title,
summary, genre, release date, list of filming locations, language, runtime, keywords and a
weekly ticket sale (theatrical weekly box office).

TrekStar pictures launches a project with a series of its materials for retail. These comprise
single-sided DVDs, double-sided DVDs, combo box sets (containing two or three DVDs), VHS
(on old projects) and Blu-rays. All of them contain features such as identification number, title
(could be different from project/film title), format, audio format (Dolby, Dolby digital, MPEG1,
PCM or DTS), run time, language, retail price, subtitles, frame aspect (wide screen).

However, each of them has different packaging specifications. A single or double DVD will
have a plastic box packaging, while a combo box set would have a cardboard box. The Blu-ray
would also have a plastic box as the DVD, but with a different size. A VHS can come in a
plastic or cardboard package.

DVDs and Blu-ray can have multiple language tracks and subtitles in different languages,
compared to VHS that can only have one subtitle and one audio track. In addition, DVDs and
Blu-rays may contain bonus features (additional material such as short films or director
comments of the production). For double-sided DVDs, it is important to know what contents
are in one side, and what in the other (chapters, bonus features and languages).

From a second meeting with a TrekStar Pictures representative, it has been clarified that in
addition to the project details and associated materials of the original brief, the system should
handle the following information and business rules:
- Projects that are currently under production are considered “unreleased” projects (these
wouldn’t have any associated materials). The system should not allow the user to input any
theatrical weekly box office information nor the addition of materials. Projects related to films
that are currently showing on cinemas are identified as “now playing”. The system should allow
the user to input theatrical weekly box office information but should not allow at this point the
addition of materials. Projects related to films that are no longer at cinemas are identified as
“released”. Only these type of projects will allow the addition of material information.

- Each project has a crew. This crew consists of all the people involved in the production of the
film such as the producer, director, writer, cast (set of actors), editor, production designer, set
decorator and costume designer.
