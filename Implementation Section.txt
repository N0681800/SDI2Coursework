You are expected to implement the above software system using C++, in particular, you are
expected to have:
• at least one of the data structures (e.g. queues/stacks/graphs/trees) proposed in lectures
(This should be implemented by yourself rather than based on other libraries);
• at least one of the sorting or searching algorithms studied during the lectures (This should
be implemented by yourself rather than based on other libraries);
• at least one place where error and exceptions handling have been used;
• at least one class where private member functions for common functionality that should not
be exposed in the public interface;
• at least a console interface that allows user to interact with the software system;
• appropriate testing cases and testing library;
Data needs to be stored permanently in ASCII (text) files on the local hard drive, hence functions
for loading data from files and for saving data from memory into a file are required. The files could
be comma separated values (CSV).

Extension
Concurrent programming where appropriate;
GUI for the software system;
